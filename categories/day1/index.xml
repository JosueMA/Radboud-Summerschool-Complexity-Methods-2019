Activities The simplest non-trivial iterative change process can be described by the following difference equation:
$$Y_{t+1} = Y_{t=0} + a*Y_t$$
The equation describes the way in which the value of \(Y\) changes between two adjacent, discrete moments in time (hence the term difference equation, or recurrence relation). There are two parameters resembling an intercept and a slope:
 The starting value \(Y_0\) at \(t=0\), also called the starting value, or the initial conditions.</description>

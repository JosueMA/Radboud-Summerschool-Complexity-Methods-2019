The main focus is on developing a so-called “person-specific” (idiographic) research paradigm in which modeling and quantification of intra-individual variability (parameters of a complex dynamical system) is more useful than modeling inter-individual variability (estimating parameters of a static population, or true value).\nFrom this perspective the current ‘Replicability Crisis’ in the social sciences could be a problem of operating within the wrong theoretical paradigm, rather than the wrong application of research methods and inferential statistics.\n\n\nMaarten Wijnants \nMy research focuses on fractal scaling as it relates to motor coordination and literacy. This review paper provides an excellent summary of my past and current work.\n\n\nRalf Cox   \nRalf Cox is currently associate professor at the Developmental Psychology group of the Department of Psychology of the University of Groningen. He received his PhD in Social Sciences (Cum Laude) at the Radboud University Nijmegen in 2007. He is also adjunct professor at the Center for Research in Human Movement Variability of the University of Nebraska at Omaha (USA) and visiting professor at the Graduate School of Psychology of the Universidad de Talca (Chile).\nHis research addresses the coordinative basis of behavior, cognition and their development. This entails a micro-genetic and complex dynamical systems approach to intra- and interpersonal coordination, as well as the advancement of nonlinear time-series techniques to study this. He has published on motor performance, planning, language development, dyslexia, mother-child, client-therapist and peer interaction, and gesture-speech attunement. \n\nAnna Lichtwarck-Aschoff \nI am born in the southern part of Germany and moved all the way up to the northern part of the Netherlands to study psychology in Groningen. I received my PhD from the University of Groningen at the department of Developmental Psychology in 2008. Currently, I am working as an assistant professor at the Radboud University Nijmegen in the research program Developmental Psychopathology. Generally, I am not so interested in whether certain interventions work but how they work. That is, I am mainly focusing on underlying processes and mechanisms of change across diagnostic categories and different treatment modalities. Eventually I hope that by understanding individual processes of change we will be able to personalize and tailor treatments to the specific needs of clients. My interest in game interventions is mainly driven by the fact that they allow us to gather fine-grained data on how individuals change across game play. Moreover, I find it inspiring to work with game developers. Although coming from very different backgrounds the linking pin for me is the explicit translation of a theory about how humans behave and change into mechanisms (or game mechanics).\n\n\nMerlijn Olthof   \nThe title of my PhD-project is: “Changing Landscapes: a complex systems approach to psychopathology and intervention”. We use principles from Synergetics, a theory of self-organization in complex systems, to formulate hypotheses about how change in psychopathology occurs. Specifically, we test the hypothesis that abrupt changes in psychopathology (order transitions) are preceded by a period of destabilization, characterized by a temporal increase in disorder called critical fluctuations, and an increased sensitivity to external influences. Early-warning signals indicative for destabilization can be useful for clinical practice, as they signal sensitive periods in which treatment efforts might be more effective.\n\n\nLisette de Jonge-Hoekstra     \nResearcher/teacher Psychology @univgroningen.\nEditor @mw_groningen, starting podcaster.\nInto levels, time scales and perspectives (#mom) of/on child development.\n \nGerrieke Druijf-van de Woestijne \nData Scientist at Neurocast\nTeacher at Radboud University Nijmegen\n\n\nComplex Systems Group at the Behavioural Science Institute https://www.ru.nl/bsi/research/group-pages/complex-systems-group/\nComplexity People at BSI Anna Bosman\nFred Hasselman\nMaarten Wijnants\nAnna Lichtwarck-Aschoff\nMarieke van Rooij\nMathijs Vervloed\nRoy Vink\nMerlijn Olthof\nAbele Michela\nWouter Oomens\nRik Kuurstra\nPia Andresen\nGerrieke van de Woestijne\nJames Twose\nFreek Oude Maatman\nAnouk van Hoogdalem\nSander Crielaard\nTon Verhoeven\nWillem Frankenhuis\nBarbara Müller\nNastasia Griffioen\nIsabela Granic\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"aa8d2ba0dda088cdc2b6e59a3f3b3b41","permalink":"/people/persons/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/people/persons/","section":"people","summary":"Instructors \u0026amp; Assistants Fred Hasselman       \nMy research and teaching centers on the development and application of theoretical frameworks and research methods to study of human behaviour, form the perspective of Complexity Science.

.Rmd\nActivities The simplest non-trivial iterative change process can be described by the following difference equation:\n$$Y_{t+1} = Y_{t=0} + a*Y_t$$\nThe equation describes the way in which the value of \\(Y\\) changes between two adjacent, discrete moments in time (hence the term difference equation, or recurrence relation). There are two parameters resembling an intercept and a slope:\n The starting value \\(Y_0\\) at \\(t=0\\), also called the starting value, or the initial conditions. A rule for incrementing time, here the change in \\(Y\\) takes place over a discrete time step of 1: \\(t+1\\).\n  The values taken on by variable \\(Y\\) are considered to represent the states quantifiable observable alternative ways to describe the change of states :\n A dynamical rule describing the propagation of the states of a system observable measured by the values of variable Y through discrete time. A dynamic law describing the time-evolution of the states of a system observable measured by the variable Y.\n  These descriptions all refer to the change processes that govern system observables (properties of dynamical systems that can be observed through measurement).\nIt\u0026rsquo;s a line! It\u0026rsquo;s a plane! The formula resembles the equation of a line. There is a constant value \\(Y_{0}\\) which is added to a proportion of the value of \\(Y\\) at time \\(t\\), given by parameter \\(a\\). This is equivalent to the slope of a line. However, in a \\((X,Y)\\) plane there are two \u0026lsquo;spatial\u0026rsquo; (metric) dimensions representing the values two variables \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) can take on (see figure).\nThe best fitting straight line would be called a statistical model of the linear relationship between the observed values of \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\). It can be obtained by fitting a General Linear Model (GLM) to the data. If \\(X\\) were to represent repeated measurements the multivariate GLM for repeated measures would have to be fitted to the data. This can be very problematic, because statistical models rely on Ergodic theory:\n \u0026rdquo;\u0026hellip; it is the study of the long term average behavior of systems evolving in time.\u0026rdquo;\n need to assume independence of measurements within and between subjects. These assumptions can be translated to certain conditions that must hold for the model to be valid, known as Compound Symmetry and Sphericity:\n The compound symmetry assumption requires that the variances (pooled within-group) and covariances (across subjects) of the different repeated measures are homogeneous (identical). This is a sufficient condition for the univariate F test for repeated measures to be valid (i.e., for the reported F values to actually follow the F distribution). However, it is not a necessary condition. The sphericity assumption is a necessary and sufficient condition for the F test to be valid; it states that the within-subject \u0026ldquo;model\u0026rdquo; consists of independent (orthogonal) components. The nature of these assumptions, and the effects of violations are usually not well-described in ANOVA textbooks; [^assumptions]\n As you can read in the quoted text above, these conditions must hold in order to be able to identify unique independent components as the sources of variation of \\(Y\\) over time within a subject. This is the a clear example of:\nIf you choose to use GLM repeated measures to model change over time, you will only be able to infer independent components that are responsible for the time-evolution of \\(Y\\). As is hinted in the last sentence of the quote, the validity of such inferences is not a common topic of discussion statistics textbooks.\nNo! \u0026hellip; It\u0026rsquo;s a time series! The important difference between a regular 2-dimensional Euclidean plane and the space in which we model change processes is that the \\(X\\)-axis represents the physical dimension time. In the case of the Linear Map we have a 1D space with one \u0026lsquo;spatial\u0026rsquo; dimension \\(Y\\) and a time dimension \\(t\\). This is called time series if \\(Y\\) is sampled as a continuous process, or a trial series if the time between subsequent observations is not relevant, just the fact that there was a temporal order (for example, a series of response latencies to trials in a psychological experiment in the order in which they were presented to the subject).\nTime behaves different from a spatial dimension in that it is directional (time cannot be reversed), it cannot take on negative values, and, unless one is dealing with a truly random process, there will be a temporal correlation across one or more values of \\(Y\\) separated by an amount of time. In the linear difference equation this occurs because each value one step in the future is calculated based on the current value. If the values of \\(Y\\) represent an observable of a dynamical system, the system can be said to have a history, or a memory.\nErgodic systems do not have a history or a memory that extends across more than one time step. This is very convenient, because one can calculate the expected value of a system observable given infinite time, by making use of of the laws of probabilities of random events (or random fields). This means: The average of an observable of an Ergodic system measured across infinite time (its entire history, the time-average), will be the be the same value as the average of this observable measured at one instance in time, but in an infinite amount of systems of the same kind (the population, the spatial average) [^dice].\nThe simple linear difference equation will have a form of perfect memory across the smallest time scale (i.e., the increment of 1, \\(t+1\\)). This \u0026lsquo;memory\u0026rsquo; just concerns a correlation of 1 between values at adjacent time points (a short range temporal correlation, SRC), because the change from \\(Y_t\\) to \\(Y_{t+1}\\) is exactly equal to \\(a * Y_t\\) at each iteration step. This is the meaning of deterministic, not that each value of \\(Y\\) is the same, but that the value of \\(Y\\) now can be perfectly explained form the value of \\(Y\\) one moment in the past.\nSummarising, the most profound difference is not the fact that the equation of linear change is a deterministic model and the GLM is a probabilistic model with parameters fitted from data, this is something we can (and will) do for \\(a\\) as well. The profound difference between the models is the role given to the passage of time:\n The linear difference equation represents changes in \\(Y\\) as a function of the physical dimension time and \\(Y\\) itself. The GLM represents changes in \\(Y\\) as a function of a linear predictor composed of additive components that can be regarded as independent sources of variation that sum up to the observed values of \\(Y\\).

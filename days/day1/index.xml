Literature  Chapter 3 of the course book explains some of the basics of difference and differential equations and how to simulate them.
 More detailed information and (formal) explanations about nonlinear phenomena can be found in:
 Kaplan, D., &amp;amp; Glass, L. (2012). Understanding nonlinear dynamics. Springer Science &amp;amp; Business Media.    Digging deeper  This series on Differential Equations is excellent, but also expecting some background knowledge.</description>
